Pendragon
===

Simply put, _**Pendragon**_ is just another single-player, RPG game. You will be a lone player who can interact with NPCs, and kill slimes and monsters. You will probably have a sword. If we feel like it. Meh...

But as uninteresting as _**Pendragon**_ seems, it is also kickass. Why, you ask? Brace yourself, because what follows is going to blow your mind...

> **We let the NPCs gossip about you.**

Confused? Are you wondering why that is, as we put it, **kickass**?

Most RPGs work this way.

1. Player completes quest.
2. Player reputation increases.
3. **Every NPC in the world knows about it immediately!!!**

Are you seriously telling me that NPCs have a _hive mind_! Obviously not, so we aim to solve that issue. The goal is to have NPCs in the vicinity acknowledge your actions as good or bad and then propagate them to the rest of the world via **gossip**. We like to call this **Ripple Gossip**.
